# Cog Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
This webserver and it's accompanying cog is built for Red Discord Bot, and Red Discord Bot ONLY. It will not work with other bots. If you haven’t already, install Red [here](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/).
{% endhint %}

Welcome to the Dashboard Cog Installation Guide. While running the below directions, the following is assumed:

1. You have an active instance of Red Discord Bot, 3.3.9+ \(you can check your version with `[p]info`\).
2. You have the `downloader` cog loaded.
3. `[p]` represents your prefix.

## Installing the cog from the repository

1. First, if you have not already, add my repository to your bot:

```bash
[p]repo add toxic https://github.com/NeuroAssassin/Toxic-Cogs
```

    2. Next, install the cog from the repo:

```bash
[p]cog install toxic dashboard
```

    3. Finally, load the cog:

```bash
[p]load dashboard
```

_You can now proceed to the cog configuration pages. If you are running one webserver, please proceed to_ [_Cog configuration with one bot_](cog-configuration-with-one-bot.md)_.
