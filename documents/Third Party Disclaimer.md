This website allows for third party integrations for more control of such plugins and for easier use.  This document will describe what may happen with Third Party Integrations.

## 1. How Third Party integrations are structured
When you navigate to a URL that includes `/third_party/` or using a widget that has a Third Party integration disclaimer, you are using a part of dashboard that connects with a connected cog that is not the supported dashboard companion cog.  Whatever data you input there or whatever actions you take there will be sent to the respective Third Party cog, NOT the dashboard companion cog.

By sending to a separate cog, this means that any code beyond that point is out of control of us.  While this code may have been approved at the time of writing, it is possible that it has changed maliciously since then.  If you use any part of these widgets or integrations, you are acknowledge that you have read this document and agree that we are not at fault for any malicious use of such data.

## 2. What to do when malicious use is detected
