# Red-Dashboard
*An easy-to-use interactive web dashboard to control your Redbot.*

# Warning
This webserver is in alpha stages.  Please refrain from installing this if you do not believe you can set this up yourself, OR do not wish to provide feedback and bug reports.  To summarize the announcement on the cog server:

> From here on forward, user issues with installing (for example, not understanding what something is) must be dealt with personally.  I will no longer be helping out with these as I do not have the time for them.  As said before, this cog is in very early stage development, and is not intended for public use, and I am looking for bugs, issues and feedback.  If you cannot understand the (relatively simple) instructions, then now is not a good time to install, and its better to wait until it is officially released.  I would recommend searching google for the answers to your questions.  If for some reason, you cannot understand how to install it at all, and I warn, ONLY if it is that, then you can DM Draper from the Red server.

Due to this project being in Alpha stages, I (or any other contributors) are in no way responsible for any damage that this project may cause to your system/bot.  Proceed at your own risk.
